# libsvm Bindings for Rust

The crate provides high level API for [cjlin1's libsvm](https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm),
which is based on [Yu Wei Wu's libsvm-sys](https://crates.io/crates/libsvm-sys).

## Usage

Append this line to `[dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`.

```
libsvm = "^0.2.0"
```

The following extra features add support for nalgebra and ndarray types.
The methods in this crate will accept matrix or multi-dimensional array types,
and convert them internally.

- **with-nalgebra**: Add nalgebra support
- **with-ndarray**: Add ndarray support

For example, if you would like to enable nalgebra support, add the line in your
`Cargo.toml`.

```
libsvm = { version = "^0.2.0", features = ["with-nalgebra"] }
```
